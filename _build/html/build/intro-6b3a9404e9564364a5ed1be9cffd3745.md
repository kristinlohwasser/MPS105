# Welcome to MPS 105: Frontiers in Physics (Particle Physics at the High Energy Frontier)

You can find notes covering the "Particle Physics at the High Energy Frontier" part of the course here. The combination of these notes and the lecture slides should give you all the material you need to cover this course. No additional reading is required for this section of the course, though thoughout the notes I will add references to some books you could look at to get a different angle or a different decription.

In this part of the course we will learn about the open questions of Patricle Physics and how we are trying to answer them using high energy particle collisions such as those happening at the LHC at CERN in Geneva Switzerland. You will get an insight into the latest findings of the ATLAS and CMS experiments are testing the Standard Model of Physics at the highest energies. These lectures will cover the following topics:

- How can we study the microscopic world (in this case: the fundamental particles and forces of nature)? How can we use high energy scattering and collisions experiments to study particle interactions?

- The Standard Model of Particle Physics: What is the particle content of the Standard Model? What are the open questions of the Standard Model and how do they relate to cosmology and the Big Band? 

- The latest piece of the Standard Model: The Higgs Boson. what do we still need to learn? And what are the latest results in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model?

Each section has a number of example questions at the end. Worked answers to these questions can be found in the final part of these notes.
