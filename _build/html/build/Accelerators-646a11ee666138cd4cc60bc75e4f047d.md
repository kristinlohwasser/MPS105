```{admonition} Calculation

Consider two quarks at a distance of 1.0 fm which are are attracting each other with a force of magnitude 2.0 $\times$ 10$^4$ N. What is the magnitude of the force at a distance of 9.0 fm?

As the force is proprotional to $r$, the magnitude of the force at 9.0 fm is 9 $\times$ the force at 1.0 fm, thus 18.0 $\times$ 10$^4$ N.
