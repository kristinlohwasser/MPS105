At the end of the 16th century, the microscope was invented to resolve and observe small structures, initially mainly biological samples such as seeds, plants, the eye of a fly and the structure of cork. Hooke, one of the first to use a microscope described the pores inside the cork as ‘cells’, the origin of the current use of the word in biology today.\n\nIn the classical limit, the smallest detail resolvable by conventional microscopy is approximately half the wavelength (2\\lambda) of the light used. For visible light, this resolution limit is around 200-250 nanometers (nm), which is sufficient for resolving cells and large organelles, but far too large for atomic or molecular structures.\n\nTo resolve smaller structures like single crystals and individual atoms, which have characteristic spacings on the scale of \\approx 0.1 to 1 \\text{ nm} (or 1 to 10 \\text{ Angstroms}), researchers must use “light” with a much shorter wavelength. For this, X-rays are commonly used as these have wavelengths comparable to the interatomic spacing in crystals. This allows for the determination of the atomic structure of crystals down to resolutions of 0.1 \\text{ nm} or better, effectively resolving the positions of the constituent atoms.\n\nTo resolve structures smaller than the size of an atom’s position, one must move beyond using light (photons) and instead employ beams of high-energy fundamental particles, such as electrons or other particles. The key principle remains the same as with light: to resolve a feature, the probe’s de Broglie wavelength (\\lambda) must be comparable to or smaller than the feature’s size. High-energy electrons can have de Broglie wavelengths of less than 0.004 \\text{ nm}, significantly shorter than the atomic spacing of \\approx 0.1 \\text{ nm}. This extremely small wavelength allows modern electron microscopes to not only resolve the regular positions of atoms in a crystal lattice but also to image individual atoms and distinguish different elements within a material, achieving resolutions approaching 0.05 \\text{ nm}.\n\nEquation\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength\n\nIn SI units (i.e. the international system of units \n\nInternational System of Units (2025)) the de Broglie wavelength is defined as:\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} \\\\\n\nHere, \\lambda is the wavelength, h is the Planck constant, p is the momentum with h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} m^2 kg/s =  6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s \n\nNuclear and Particle physics requires going to even smaller scales: Electrons and protons are most often used in order to test the structure of matter.

The experiment was part of a series of experiments performed between 1906 and 1913 that investigated the atomic structure.\n\nThe experiment involved positively charged \\alpha particles (Helium nuclei consisting of two protons and two neutrons) that were guided in a beam at a thin sheet of gold foil. The source of the \\alpha particles was radium, as it was one of the most radioacive elements known at that time. Gold was chosen for the foil as it is the most malleable metal and therefore easiest material to manufacture a thin foil with. The deflection of the \\alpha particles was measured using a phosphorescent screen surrounding the gold foil. Each particle impacting on the screen produced a tiny flash of light that was detected “by eye”: Geiger worked in a darkened laboratory for hours, counting the scintillations using a microscope and noting the results down.\n\nThe results showed that most alpha particles passed straight through the foil however some were deflected at large angles of more than 90 degrees and even up to 180 degrees. This disproved the plum pudding model of the atom that had been proposed by Thompson.\n\nRutherford drew the conclusion that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus as explained in his 1911 paper\n\nRutherford (1911) that eventually led to the widespread use of scattering in particle physics to study subatomic matter. The paper was primarily about alpha particle scattering in an era before particle scattering was a primary tool for physics.\n\nIn the following we will see how scattering experiments are used as a tool to understand the basic constituents of matter. The Geiger Marsden experiment is used to demonstrate the basic principles of these measurements.\n\nCalculation\n\nScattering angle in the Geiger Marsden Experiment\n\nFrom the scattering measured in the experiment, we can deduce something on the relationship of the \\alpha particles and the gold atoms (or the scattering centre).\n\nEnergy conservation:   \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\frac{1}{2} m_\\alpha {v^2_\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2} m_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{2} m_t {v'^2_t} \nMomentum conservation: \\,\\,\\, m_\\alpha \\vec{v_\\alpha} = m_\\alpha \\vec{v'_\\alpha} + m_t \\vec{v'_t} \n\nEnergy conservation:\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} m_\\alpha {v^2_\\alpha} &= \\frac{1}{2} m_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{2} m_t {v'^2_t} &\\biggr\\rvert \\div\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nm_\\alpha {v^2_\\alpha} &=  m_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha} +  m'_t {v'^2_t}  &\\biggr\\rvert \\; \\textrm{multiply by  } m_\\alpha \\\\\nm^2_\\alpha {v^2_\\alpha} &=  m^2_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha} +  m_\\alpha m_t {v'^2_t} &\n\\end{align*}\n\nMomentum conservation:\\begin{align*}\nm_\\alpha \\vec{v_\\alpha} &= m_\\alpha \\vec{v'_\\alpha} + m'_t \\vec{v'_t} \\; &\\biggr\\rvert \\; \\textrm{square both sides} \\\\\nm^2_\\alpha {v^2_\\alpha} &= m^2_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha} + m^2_t {v'^2_t} + 2 m_\\alpha m_t \\vec{v'_\\alpha}\\cdot \\vec{v'_t} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow set (2) and (3) equal:\\begin{align*}\n\\cancel{m^2_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha}} +  m_\\alpha m_t {v'^2_t} &= \\cancel{m^2_\\alpha {v'^2_\\alpha}} + m^2_t {v'^2_t} + 2 m_\\alpha m_t \\vec{v'_\\alpha}\\cdot \\vec{v'_t} \\\\\nm_\\alpha m_t {v'^2_t} &= m^2_t {v'^2_t} + 2 m_\\alpha m_t \\vec{v'_\\alpha}\\cdot \\vec{v'_t} \\;\\;\\;\\biggr\\rvert \\; - m^2_t {v'^2_t}, \\div m_\\alpha m_t  \\\\\n{v'^2_t} \\left(1 - \\frac{m_t}{m_\\alpha} \\right) &= 2 \\vec{v'_\\alpha}\\cdot \\vec{v'_t} \\\\\n{v'^2_t} \\left(1 - \\frac{m_t}{m_\\alpha}\\right) &= 2 {v'_\\alpha}{v'_t} \\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the above calculation using energy and momentum conservation, we deduce the following relationship:{v'^2_t} \\left(1 - \\frac{m_t}{m_\\alpha}\\right) = {v'_\\alpha}{v'_t} \\cos\\theta\n\nWe can analyse the equation without even knowing much about the concrete values:\n\nLooking at the right-hand side, we find we have the multiplication of two velocities - this product is for sure positive (as there are not negative velocities). The other term on the right-hand side is \\cos\\theta which is positive between -90° and +90°. However, \\cos\\theta is negative for any angles larger than 90°. So the right-hand side takes on a \\textit{negative} value for scattering angles larger than 90°. This of course means, that also the left-hand side needs to be negative in these cases.\n\nTherefore, let’s take a look at the left-hand side of the equation. Again, {v'^2_t} will always be positive, so \\left(1 - \\frac{m_t}{m_\\alpha}\\right) needs to be negative, i.e. zero is larger than the left-hand side:\\begin{align*}\n0&>\\left(1 - \\frac{m_t}{m_\\alpha}\\right)\\\\\n\\frac{m_t}{m_\\alpha} &> 1\\\\\nm_t &> m_\\alpha\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis shows that the target mass is larger than that of the \\alpha particle. In fact it’s much larger by roughly a factor of 40: M(Au) \\sim 40 \\times M(alpha). This indicates, there is a solid heavy “ball” inside the atom, not a soft distributed mass.\n\nThere is more we can learn, again using energy conservation. When the positively charged \\alpha particle approaches the also positively charged gold nucleus it experiences a repelling force and as a consequence its kinetic energy gets converted into potential energy until it (equivalent to a ball that is tossed into the air with an initial velocity, its kinetic energy gets converted into potential energy in the gravitational field of the earth until its velocity at its highest point is zero, at which point it turns to be accelerated by the gravitational towards earth).\n\nUsing this approach we can estimate the size of an atomic nuclei as we can estimate how close the \\alpha particles get towards it.\n\nCalculation\n\nDistance of closest approach in the Geiger Marsden Experiment\n\nThe potential energy of the alpha particle with charge q_\\alpha at a distance r from the gold nuclei with charge Q_{\\textrm{AU}} is:U = E_\\textrm{pot} = \\frac{q_\\alpha Q_{\\textrm{AU}}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r}\n\n(see also PHY11006 lecture notes: \\textit{5.5 The Potential and Potential Energy of a System of Charges})\n\nThe \\alpha particles and the gold nuclei repell each other as they are both positively charged. In order to estimate how close they can get, we can compare the kinetic energy of the \\alpha particles to the potential energy caused by the charges. The kinetic energy is “used up” in order to overcome the repelling force of the electric field of the nuclei. Thus, the Kinetic energy (at t=0, i.e. when the particle approach from infinity) and potential energy are equal at the “distance of closest approach”, the point at which the \\alpha particles are the closest to the gold nuclei, before they are deflected away from the nuclei.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the \\alpha particles in the Geiger Marsden experiment is E_\\textrm{kin} = 5.30 MeV. The charges of the \\alpha particles and the gold nuclei are q_\\alpha = 2e and Q_\\textrm{AU}=79e respectively.\\begin{align*}\nE_\\textrm{kin} &= E_\\textrm{pot} \\\\\nE_\\textrm{kin} &= \\frac{q_\\alpha Q_{\\textrm{AU}}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r} \\;  \\;  \\;  \\;  \\; \\biggr\\rvert \\div  E_\\textrm{kin} ; \\times r     \\\\\nr &= \\frac{q_\\alpha Q_{\\textrm{AU}}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E_\\textrm{kin}}\\\\\n &= \\frac{2 \\times 79 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2 C^2 }{5.30 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} x 10^6 J} \\times 9\\times 10^9 \\frac{N m^2}{C^2}\\\\\n&= 4.3 \\times 10^{-14} m \\\\ &= 43 fm\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe \\alpha particles do not come closer than 43 fm to the nucleus - the nucleus therefore is smaller than this!

In particle physics, the relationship between energy, momentum and mass is derivated using special relativity and can be expressed in this simple formula:\n\nEquation\n\nRelativistic relationship between energy, momentum and massE^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 \\\\\n\nHere, E is the energy, p is momentum, m is mass and c is the speed of light. In the case, that the kinetic energy of a particle can be neglected with respect to its mass, E=mc^2, the well-known Einstein formula. In cases, where the kinetic energy of a particle excess its mass, we can write E=pc. For most of the cases in this course, we will use E=pc unless stated otherwise.\n\nGiven the relativistic relationship between energy, momentum and mass, the unit of momentum is eV/c, whilst mass is eV/c^2\n\nExample\n\nExample: Mass of the Proton\\begin{align*}\nm c^2 &= 1.67 \\times 10^{-27} kg \\times \\left( 3 \\times 10^8 m/s \\right)^2 = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9} J \\\\\n1.5 \\times 10^{-9} J &= 1.5 \\times 10^{-9} / 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\; \\textrm{eV} = 939 \\;\\; \\textrm{MeV}\n\\end{align*}\n\nIt is useful to be mindful of unit prefixes, as these will be used throughout the course and are generally useful for the course of your degree.\n\nPrefix\n\nSymbol\n\nFactor\n\nPower\n\ntera\n\nT\n\n1,000,000,000,000\n\n10^{12}\n\ngiga\n\nG\n\n1,000,000,000\n\n10^{9}\n\nmega\n\nM\n\n1,000,000\n\n10^{6}\n\nkilo\n\nk\n\n1,000\n\n10^{3}\n\nmilli\n\nm\n\n0.001\n\n10^{-3}\n\nmicro\n\nμ\n\n0.000001\n\n10^{-6}\n\nnano\n\nn\n\n0.000000001\n\n10^{-9}\n\npico\n\np\n\n0.000000000001\n\n10^{-12}\n\nfemto\n\nf\n\n0.000000000000001\n\n10^{-15}","type":"content","url":"/scattering#general-basics-of-scattering-experiments-in-high-energy-physics","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Part 1: Investigating the microscopic World","lvl2":"Cross-sections and their measurement"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/scattering#cross-sections-and-their-measurement","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Part 1: Investigating the microscopic World","lvl2":"Cross-sections and their measurement"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/scattering#cross-sections-and-their-measurement","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Part 1: Investigating the microscopic World","lvl3":"What is a cross-section?","lvl2":"Cross-sections and their measurement"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/scattering#what-is-a-cross-section","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Part 1: Investigating the microscopic World","lvl3":"What is a cross-section?","lvl2":"Cross-sections and their measurement"},"content":"In the Geiger-Marsden experiment, whilst some \\alpha particles are scattered by large angle, others are not deflected at all.

So when Rutherford looked into deriving a formula to describe the scattering occuring the Geiger-Marsden experiment, he assumed, there is no energy loss in the collision, that is he ignores the recoil of the target atom. It also seems, that the electrons have no impact on the scattering as the size of the nucleus, the scattering centre is so much smaller than that of the atoms. Under these conditions, the \\alpha particle and nucleus interact through a central force, a physical problem studied already by Isaac Newton and that you have covered in \n\nLecture 8, Y1 Mechanics (2025). This problem considers a central force that only acts along a line between the particles and where the force varies with the inverse square, like Coulomb force in this case.\n\nAs shown in \n\nLecture 8, Y1 Mechanics (2025), a potential of the form V = k/r will lead to the following relationship between the scattering angle and the impact parameter b:cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{m^2 b}{k}\n\nwith \\theta being the scattering angle (note: \n\nLecture 8, Y1 Mechanics (2025) this is called \\phi, but in particle physics this angle is always called \\theta), m the mass of the \\alpha particles, k the parameters of the potential and b the impact parameter or the point of closest approach, which is the vertical distance between the alpha particle’s initial trajectory and the nucleus.\n\nWhile b might be a reasonable quantity to use in astronomical problems (Kepler used the same approach to calculate the movement of celestial bodies), it is not possible to measure b in the Geiger-Marsden experiment. Therefore, the challenge is to find a way to relate the scattering angle to a quantity that can actually be measured in these sorts of scattering experiments and this is what Rutherford did to explain the experiment.\n\nThe procedure is the following:\n\nexpress the fraction of the flux passing through the band/annular b and deflected by an angle \\theta\n\ncompare this to the general expression for the differential cross section\n\nconnect it to the expression of the impact parameter derived using angular momentum and the potential (\n\nLecture 8, Y1 Mechanics (2025))\n\nGeometrical layout of the Geiger-Marsden experiment as used by Rutherford (taken from \n\nDemtröder (2006))\n\nCalculation\n\nRutherford scattering angle\n\nFrom geometrical considerations (i.e. just defining the rate of particles scattered into a solid angle without assuming anything more on the geometry) we can see that that:\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\Delta J}{J A} = n_G \\Delta x \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\Omega} \\Delta \\Omega \n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is the general form of the differental cross-section.\n\nLet us now assume a parallel beam of incident particles \\alpha with particle flux density J (with J = dN/dt) that passes through a layer of particles B in rest with density n_\\textrm{G}. All particles \\alpha that pass through an annular with radius b and width db around an atom G are deflected by the angle \\theta \\pm \\textrm{d}\\theta/2. This assumes a sperically symmetric interaction potential: There is no prefered direction (along the ring with radius b). Per second,  dJ = J dA = dN/dt dA = dN/dt 2\\pi b db particles \\alpha pass through the annular ring (with A being the area). The fraction of all particles \\alpha (incident per unit area and per second onto the target) scattered through an interaction with one single particle G into the range of deflection angles \\theta \\pm \\textrm{d}\\theta/2 is therefore:\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} J (\\theta \\pm 1/2 \\; \\mathrm{d}\\theta)}{J} = 2 \\pi b \\textrm{d}b = 2 \\pi b \\frac{\\textrm{d}b}{\\textrm{d} \\theta} \\textrm{d} \\theta\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf we place a detector with an area A_D = R^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = R^2 \\sin\\theta \\mathrm{d}\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\phi in a distance R from the scattering centre G, then this detector receives a fraction of the particles scattered by this one particle G:\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} J (\\theta, \\phi)}{J} \\frac{\\textrm{d}\\phi}{2\\pi} = b \\frac{\\textrm{d}b}{\\textrm{d} \\theta} \\textrm{d} \\theta \\textrm{d} \\phi\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe fraction of all incident particles \\alpha, scattered by all atoms G with density n_G in the volume V = A \\Delta x is then:\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} J (\\theta, \\textrm{d}\\Omega)}{J} &= n_G A \\Delta x b \\frac{\\textrm{d}b}{\\textrm{d} \\theta} \\textrm{d} \\theta \\textrm{d} \\phi \n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is a specific cross-section (in terms of geometry) that takes into account the impact paramter b and the scattering angle \\theta.

(72) use \\phi - this is the same angle, just a different name. For scattering angles, especially in particle physics, the angle is \\theta, so this is what we use here.
